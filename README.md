I feel I have fairly successfully met the criteria for this project - albeit not being very creative as only replicating the given example website - however, I have gained invaluable experience in this task. I have been able to see the example website as a template, and manipulate my html using the necessary styling within CSS, such as flexbox and positioning. I have also discovered the z-index for positioning a scrolling nav bar. I have explored with different ways to size properties (I like using rem - my understanding of this is that it keeps element size relative... allowing for responsive design).
I have found CSS Flexbox a bit hard to get my head around, in regards to what element/class it needs to be applied to, but I think I have hacked it through this exercise.
I wanted to figure out how to turn the navbar into a burger menu but the example code I was seeing online didn't quite make sense, and due to time contraints I haven't been able to complete this challenge for myself at this time.
